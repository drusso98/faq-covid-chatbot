# FAQ Covid19 Chatbot
The aim of this project is to create a Support Chatbot able to answer questions concerning COVID-19 virus. All the answers are taken from the  World Health Organization Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). This chatbot relies on Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

The Chatbot here implemented is equipped with a speech recognition module and a GUI to better interact with it.  

In the chatbot.ipynb file, alongside the code, there is a detailed description of the project.
